"""Unified colour theme for the Archie TUI.

All colour values are defined once as module constants. The Textual Theme
references these constants, making them available as $variables in TCSS.
Rich markup imports the constants via `from archie_cli.tui import theme` and
accesses them as `theme.PRIMARY`, `theme.MUTED`, etc.
